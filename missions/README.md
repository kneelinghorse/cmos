# Mission Templates

Mission Protocol templates that ship with the CMOS starter now live under `missions/templates/`.

- Reference these files when bootstrapping new missions.
- Add project- or sprint-specific missions inside your working directory outside of the starter bundle.
- Keep backlog, research notes, and active sprint planning data in your dedicated planning workspace (pass its path to tooling via `--data-root` when needed).
